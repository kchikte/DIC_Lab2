      "‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have preset menus, or really plan ahead. We drive to Maine a couple days in advance with salt, olive oil, butter, a pig, knives and, oh yeah, wine,‚Äù says Tom Mylan of the Meat Hook, Brooklyn‚Äôs buzziest butcher shop. ‚ÄúWhen we arrive on the coast, we look at what‚Äôs fresh and plentiful, and take it from there.‚Äù\n",
      "Clearly, this is not your typical epicurean affair.\n",
      "Don‚Äôt expect to get formally wined and dined, or waited on hand and foot. Do, however, be prepared to roll up your sleeves and engage in boisterous lessons alongside cooks at the top of their culinary game. Workshops and demonstrations include pig butchering, chicken slaughtering, charcuterie, cheese making, pickling and pie making. The chef Dennis Spina, from Roebling Tea Room, and the chef Millicent Souris are on site to prepare lunches and dinners with all that has been foraged, caught and slaughtered. Mark Firth, who formerly owned Diner and Marlow & Sons, is on deck to keep wine flowing and spirits high.\n",
      "From the first night‚Äôs welcoming at Three Tides Brewery, which Mylan calls ‚Äúthe coolest bar in the world,‚Äù to the final evening‚Äôs oceanside lobster boil, the Maine Event aims to be all that we want from a summer escape: pure, delicious, unadulterated fun.\n",
      "Did we mention the booze-fueled BB gun shooting contest?\n",
      "The Maine Event costs $1,000 per person, which includes all meals, drinks (provided by Brooklyn‚Äôs Vine Wine) and scheduled activities. Call (207) 230-0966 or e-mail annemarie@saltwaterfarm.com for reservations.\n",
      "The Scarfacity appealed to hip-hop artists immediately. ‚ÄúI saw it the year it came out,‚Äù Raekwon, the Wu-Tang Clan rapper, wrote in an e-mail.  ‚ÄúI was a young boy chilling in the movie theatre mesmerized by the story.

      "BAGHDAD ‚Äî An 8-year-old Iraqi girl was killed Saturday and several other civilians were wounded when gunfire from an American military convoy struck a crowd of Shiite pilgrims traveling to the holy city of Karbala, witnesses and Iraqi officials said.\n",
      "The shooting came at a delicate time for American forces in Iraq, after a security agreement between the United States and Iraq set new ground rules that greatly limit American military actions. When American forces are operating outside their bases, the agreement requires them to consult directly with their Iraqi counterparts.\n",
      "Iraqi officials have said that the Americans violated the agreement twice in recent weeks by attacking Iraqi criminal suspects without consulting Iraqi forces.\n",

      "The shooting on Saturday seemed to fall into another category, occurring while the Americans were on an official mission guarding a supply convoy but were not pursuing any Iraqi suspects. While condemned by local officials, it drew a surprisingly muted public response, perhaps a reflection of how rare American military actions are in that part of Iraq.\n",

      "The road was crowded with pilgrims heading to Karbala, witnesses said. Salah Mon‚Äôem, 26, who was wounded, said the patrol had sounded horns to keep the crowds at bay. Before he realized what was happening, he said, ‚ÄúI fell down because of a bullet that hit me.‚Äù\n",

      "Lawyers for the journalist had tried to get a reduction in  the charges stemming from the episode, which made him a folk hero in much of the Arab world and beyond. In setting a trial date, however, Iraq‚Äôs top court, the Higher Federal Court, let the most serious charges stand. If convicted, he could face as many as 15 years in prison.\n",

      "If the two detectives can prove that they were not acting recklessly or with criminal intent in firing their first shots at Mr. Bell and his friends in Queens on Nov. 25, 2006, then the shots that followed ‚Äî 40 more rounds between them ‚Äî could be determined to be justified as well, said lawyers who have represented police officers in the past and people who have been briefed on the case. A third detective faces two misdemeanor charges.\n",
      "Two details of the case are likely to be brought to bear on the question of justification. Mr. Bell, who was driving the car that drew the fire of the officers, had been drinking that night (an autopsy found that his blood alcohol level was well above the legal limit for driving, according to people briefed on the results). The car struck one of the detectives and then crashed into an unmarked van carrying other officers, the police said.\n",
      "In addition, one of the men wounded along with Mr. Bell that night has testified before a grand jury that there was talk of someone having a gun outside the nightclub where they had gone to Mr. Bell‚Äôs bachelor party, according to the people briefed on the case. The testimony ‚Äî the first known account by someone other than a police official to establish that there was talk of a gun that night ‚Äî could possibly bolster the claim by the officers that they had reason to fear for their lives.\n",

      "Mr. Bell, 23, was killed on what was to have been his wedding day, after he and his friends celebrated at Club Kalua in Jamaica, Queens.\n",
      "The club was the target of an undercover police investigation for drugs and prostitution. The police said that after Mr. Bell and his friends argued with a man near a parked S.U.V. outside the club, officers followed Mr. Bell to his car, believing he and two of his friends, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, were retrieving a gun.\n",
      "No gun was found in Mr. Bell‚Äôs car. Mr. Guzman and Mr. Benefield have said the officers did not identify themselves as police before the shooting began.\n",
      "Detective Michael Oliver and Detective Gescard F. Isnora, who together fired a total of 42 rounds, face charges of first- and second-degree manslaughter, which could bring a sentence of 25 years in prison if they are convicted. Detective Marc Cooper, who fired four shots, faces two misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment, which could bring a sentence of a year in prison. Another detective and a police officer, who were not charged, fired another four shots between them.\n",
      "In his testimony before the grand jury last March, Mr. Guzman, one of the men who were wounded, said another friend of Mr. Bell‚Äôs, James Kollore, had threatened the man at the S.U.V. and said he would take his gun or make him eat his gun, people briefed on the case said. The people describing the statements spoke on the condition of anonymity because the trial has not begun.\n",
      "Mr. Kollore, reached by telephone this week, declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Guzman, Sanford Rubenstein, said the statement had no bearing on whether the shooting was justified. ‚ÄúNo one in the Bell party had a gun,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThese comments totally relate to a third party who was pretending to have a gun.‚Äù\n",
      "As to Mr. Bell‚Äôs behavior, trial testimony is expected to show that his autopsy found his blood alcohol level to be between 0.16 percent and 0.23 percent, according to people briefed on the case. The legal limit for driving is 0.08 percent.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The trial is scheduled to begin Monday in Queens Criminal Court and is expected to last several weeks. Hours and hours of testimony in the courtroom will examine a time span of less than a minute on a gritty side street in Jamaica.\n",
      "Prosecutors have declined to discuss the case before trial. Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, said Wednesday, ‚ÄúThe case should be tried in the courtroom and not on the courthouse steps.‚Äù\n",
      "But Michael Hardy, a lawyer representing Mr. Bell‚Äôs fianc√©e, Nicole Paultre Bell, described the prosecution‚Äôs challenges at trial. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve got a yeoman‚Äôs task,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúProof beyond a reasonable doubt truly is the most difficult burden to meet, and their task will be no less than that. But that evidence is there.‚Äù\n",
      "The trial approaches with one key factor already in place: the decision last month by defense lawyers to present their case solely to a judge, Justice Arthur J. Cooperman.\n",
      "Both sides will probably give up something in the change from a jury trial to a bench trial. For example, there will likely be less emotional testimony from members of Mr. Bell‚Äôs family, including Ms. Bell, who took her fianc√©‚Äôs name after his death. Such charged moments may have made a powerful impact on jurors, but may have less evidentiary value to the judge.\n",
      "On the other hand, there will probably be less attention paid to the arrest records of Mr. Bell and his two friends in the car that night. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd hear about it more for credibility purposes in front of a jury,‚Äù one of the people briefed on the case said. ‚ÄúA judge will hear about it, but not dwell on it.

      "All three officers testified before a grand jury last year. The effect of that testimony at trial remains to be seen. If one of the detectives contradicts his prior statements on the witness stand at trial, prosecutors can use his grand jury testimony to discredit him. While one or more are expected to testify at trial, it is unclear whether all three will, people briefed on the case said.\n",
      "The basic outline of the night has changed little since Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly‚Äôs statement hours after the shooting.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Officers from an undercover team had made two recent arrests at Club Kalua, a topless bar at 143-08 94th Avenue, and arrived that night in hopes of making a third, which would speed up the process of shutting the club down. Detective Isnora and two other detectives in plainclothes were inside the club when Detective Isnora heard a dancer complain to a man in a White Sox cap that someone had harassed her. The man took her hand, patted a bulge in his clothing that the detective believed to be a gun, and told her that he would take care of the problem, the police said.\n",
      "The detective alerted the rest of the police team waiting in vehicles, and he left the club. But outside, a new situation arose that changed the course of the police operation. Mr. Bell‚Äôs group was arguing with the man next to the black S.U.V. about a dancer who had indicated she would have sex with the men in the bachelor party. The man kept his right hand in his jacket pocket, as if he had a gun, the police said.\n",
      "Detective Isnora has said he then heard Mr. Guzman say, ‚ÄúYo, get my gun, get my gun,‚Äù and heard Mr. Bell say that they should beat up the man, the police said. Mr. Guzman has denied making any such statement.\n",
      "Mr. Bell and his friends, some eight men in all, split into two groups, with Mr. Bell, Mr. Guzman and Mr. Benefield walking around the corner onto Liverpool Street toward Mr. Bell‚Äôs car. It was then that Detective Isnora alerted the commanding officer that night, Lt. Gary Napoli, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting hot on Liverpool, for real. I think there‚Äôs a gun,‚Äù the police said.\n",
      "As Detective Isnora approached Mr. Bell‚Äôs car, Lieutenant Napoli‚Äôs vehicle drove past, stopping down the street, while a van carrying Detective Oliver and an officer, Michael Carey, stopped short behind Detective Isnora.\n",
      "Detective Isnora had clipped his badge to his collar and pulled his pistol, ordering Mr. Bell to stop, the police said, but Mr. Bell‚Äôs car lurched forward, striking him in the leg and hitting Detective Oliver‚Äôs van. The car then drove backward, hitting a roll-up gate, then forward again, slamming into the van before coming to a halt, the police said.\n",
      "Sometime after Mr. Bell drove the car forward, Detective Isnora fired the first shot and emptied his gun, shooting 11 times. Detective Oliver fired 16 shots, reloaded with a magazine holding 15 rounds, and emptied the gun again.\n",
      "The detectives‚Äô defense is expected to examine police training and its emphasis on eliminating the threat before an officer, and not on counting bullets.\n",

While a record 12 of the 26 Division I-A and I-AA universities that hired head coaches received overall grades of A, a record six also received F‚Äôs, including five who received the failing marks for not reporting to the black coaches group on what steps they took to consider minority coaches. They included Wisconsin, Rice and Boise State.\n",
      "Three of the 12 universities that received overall A grades this year ‚Äî Buffalo, Columbia and Southeast Missouri State ‚Äî hired black head coaches. Kansas State, which also hired a black  coach, received a B.\n",
      "Taylor, a 6-foot junior from New Brunswick, N.J., turned himself in last Friday after learning of a warrant for his arrest. The police accused Taylor of obtaining a credit card number and using it for several purchases without the owner‚Äôs consent. He was charged with sixth-degree larceny, a misdemeanor, and illegal use of a credit card.\n",
      "A day after his arrest, Taylor started in UConn‚Äôs 24-13 loss to Wake Forest. He had five and a half tackles and forced a fumble. He was on two years‚Äô probation after being one of five players arrested in a pellet-gun shooting outside a convenience store in May 2005.\n",

      "If Democrats want to know how to win again, they have a model. It's the British Labor Party.\n",
      "When I studied in England in the early 1980's, the British Labor Party seemed as quaint and eccentric as Oxford itself, where we wore gowns for exams and some dons addressed the rare female student as \"sir.\" Labor was caught in its own echo chamber of militant unions and anti-American activists, and it so repulsed voters that it seemed it might wither away entirely.\n",
      "Then Tony Blair and another M.P., Gordon Brown, dragged the party away from socialism, unions, nuclear disarmament and anti-Americanism. Together they created \"New Labor,\" which aimed for the center and aggressively courted Middle Britain instead of trying to scare it. The result is that since 1997, Mr. Blair and Labor have utterly dominated Britain.\n",
      "The Democrats need a similar rebranding. But the risk is that the party will blame others for its failures -- or, worse, blame the American people for their stupidity (as London's Daily Mirror screamed in a Page 1 headline this week: \"How can 59,054,087 people be so DUMB?\").\n",
      "As moderates from the heartland, like Tom Daschle, are picked off by the Republicans, the party's image risks being defined even more by bicoastal, tree-hugging, gun-banning, French-speaking, Bordeau-sipping, Times-toting liberals, whose solution is to veer left and galvanize the base. But firing up the base means turning off swing voters. Gov. Mike Johanns, a Nebraska Republican, told me that each time Michael Moore spoke up for John Kerry, Mr. Kerry's support in Nebraska took a dive.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Mobilizing the base would mean nominating Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2008 and losing yet again. (Mrs. Clinton has actually undertaken just the kind of makeover that I'm talking about: in the Senate, she's been cooperative, mellow and moderate, winning over upstate New Yorkers. She could do the same in the heartland if she had 50 years.)\n",

      "So Democrats need to give a more prominent voice to Middle American, wheat-hugging, gun-shooting, Spanish-speaking, beer-guzzling, Bible-toting centrists. (They can tote The Times, too, in a plain brown wrapper.) For a nominee who could lead the Democrats to victory, think of John Edwards, Bill Richardson or Evan Bayh, or anyone who knows the difference between straw and hay.\n",
      "I wish that winning were just a matter of presentation. But it's not. It involves compromising on principles. Bill Clinton won his credibility in the heartland partly by going home to Little Rock during the 1992 campaign to preside over the execution of a mentally disabled convict named Ricky Ray Rector.\n",
      "There was a moral ambiguity about Mr. Clinton's clambering to power over Mr. Rector's corpse. But unless Democrats compromise, they'll be proud and true and losers.\n",

      "So what do the Democrats need to do? Here are four suggestions:\n",
      "Don't be afraid of religion. Offer government support for faith-based programs to aid the homeless, prisoners and AIDS victims. And argue theology with Republicans: there's much more biblical ammunition to support liberals than conservatives.\n",
      "Pick battles of substance, not symbolism. The battle over Georgia's Confederate flag cost Roy Barnes his governorship and perhaps Max Cleland his Senate seat, but didn't help one working mother or jobless worker. It was a gift to Republicans.\n",
      "Accept that today, gun control is a nonstarter. Instead of trying to curb guns, try to reduce gun deaths through better rules on licensing and storage, and on safety devices like trigger locks.\n",
      "Hold your nose and work with President Bush as much as you can because it's lethal to be portrayed as obstructionists. Sure, block another Clarence Thomas, but here's a rule of thumb: if an otherwise qualified Supreme Court nominee would turn the clock back 10 years, approve; back 25 years, vote no; back a half-century, filibuster.\n",
      "\"The first thing we have to do is shake the image of us as the obstructionist party,\" notes Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, who manages to thrive as a Democrat in the red sea. He says Democrats must show a willingness to compromise, to get things done, to defer to local sensibilities. \"We have to show the American people,\" he says, \"that Democrats aren't going to take away your guns, aren't going to take away your flags.\"\n",
      "Rethinking the Democratic Party will be wrenching. But just ask Tony Blair -- it's not as wrenching as sliding into irrelevance.\n",
