Conservatism is based on a Strict Father model, while liberalism is centered on a Nurturant Parent model. These two models of the family give rise to different moral systems.Three trends — polarization, media change, and the rise of what many people see as threats to the traditional social order — have contributed to a growing divide within American politics. It is a divide between those who place heavy value on social order and cohesion relative to those who value personal autonomy and independence.The authors found that in 1992, 62 percent of white voters who ranked highest on the authoritarian scale supported George H.W. Bush. In 2016, 86 percent of the most authoritarian white voters backed Trump, an increase of 24 percentage points.Federico, Feldman and Weber conclude thatAuthoritarianism is now more deeply bound up with partisan identities. It has become part and parcel of Republican identity among non-Hispanic white Americans.In an email, Johnston summarized some of their findings:Over the last few decades, party allegiances have become increasingly tied to a core dimension of personality we call “openness.” Citizens high in openness value independence, self-direction, and novelty, while those low in openness value social cohesion, certainty, and security. Individual differences in openness seem to underpin many social and cultural disputes, including debates over the value of racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity, law and order, and traditional values and social norms.As these social and cultural conflicts have become a bigger part of our political debates, citizens have sorted into different parties based on personality, with citizens high in openness much more likely to be liberals and Democrats than those low in openness. This psychological sorting process does not line up perfectly with older partisan differences based on class, because those higher in income and education also tend to be higher in openness.Johnston addresses class differences in voting patterns and also differences stemming from the level of a voter’s interest in politics:An important caveat is that individuals who take a stronger interest in politics and know more about it are more likely to be sorted on the basis of openness. So, it’s really among those most “politically engaged” Democrats and Republicans where we see members of different parties diverge in openness. Moreover, sorting into different parties on the basis of openness appears to be much stronger among non-Hispanic whites than other racial and ethnic groups.In their book, Johnston, Lavine and Federico reinforce this point:With the rise of cultural and lifestyle politics, Democrats and Republicans are now sharply distinguished by a set of psychological dispositions related to experiential openness — a general dimension of personality tapping tolerance for threat and uncertainty in one’s environment.The revived interest in authoritarianism in politics began well before anyone seriously considered the possibility of a Trump candidacy — except, apparently, Trump himself.In it, Hetherington and Weiler argue thatpreferences about many of the new issues on the American political agenda, such as gay rights, the war in Iraq, the proper response to terrorism, and immigration are likely structured by authoritarianism.There are “colliding conceptions of right and wrong,” they write, between those on the high and low ends of the authoritarian scale. That, in turn, makes it difficult “for one side of the political debate to understand (perhaps, in the extreme, even respect) how the other side thinks and feels.”In an email to me, Hetherington said that in their book he and Weiler will describe “people on opposite sides of the divide as having a fixed or fluid worldview:”Those with a fixed worldview tend to see “American Carnage,” while those with fluid worldviews see the world as a big, beautiful place that is safe to explore. The fixed tend to be wary of what they perceive as constant threats to their physical security specifically and of social change in general. The fluid are much more open to change and, indeed, see it as a strength. For them, anger lies in holding on to old ideas and rejecting diversity.Hetherington and Weiler argue that the answers to questions about the four childhood traits reveal “how worldview guides a person in navigating the world,” as Hetherington put it in his email:Not only do the answers to these questions explain preferences about race, immigration, sexual orientation, gender attitudes, the projection of military force, gun control, and just about every “culture war” issue, people’s worldviews also undergird people’s life choices. Because ‘the fixed’ are wary about the dangers around them, they prefer the country over the city. ‘The fluid’ prefer the reverse.Political analysts have become more and more aware of how voters’ sense of themselves as liberals or conservatives, Democrats or Republicans, has taken on heightened importance. Affirming one’s political tribe or community has in many respects become more important in deciding whom to vote for than the stands candidates take on issues.The power behind the labels “liberal” and “conservative” to predict strong preferences for the ideological in-group is based largely in the social identification with those groups, not in the organization of attitudes associated with the labels. That is, even when we are discussing ideology — a presumably issue-based concept — we are not entirely discussing issues.Mason continued:Identity-based ideology can drive affective ideological polarization even when individuals are naïve about policy. The passion and prejudice with which we approach politics is driven not only by what we think, but also powerfully by who we think we are.They measure aversion to change by the answers to two polling questions: “Our country is changing too fast, undermining traditional American values” and “By accepting diverse cultures and lifestyles, our country is steadily improving.”The accompanying graphic shows how those who think that the country is changing too fast and who disagree with the notion that diverse cultures and lifestyles improve the United States voted decisively for Trump.Leonie Huddy, a political scientist at Stony Brook, sent me her analysis of how political conflict has shifted from economic to psychological factors.The groups that have come to define partisanship in recent years, she wrote,are far more grounded in social and moral values, geographic choice, and identity politics than the influential groups of yesteryear (especially unions) that maintained a focus on group economic interests. African-Americans may be an exception, but there is even a trend among young blacks to move away from the Democratic Party because they see the party as insufficiently focused on police brutality and other issues.The result, in her words, is a political environment in whichthe new affinities that shape partisanship are more a matter of choice than something one is born into or passed on by parents. That gives partisanship a more fluid nature than in the past and opens it to the formation of affinities grounded in personality, values, religion, and lifestyle choices.Stenner demonstrated, first, that levels of authoritarianism rise and fall in proportion to the experience of “normative threat,” and second that over the past generation authoritarianism has been predictive of Republican voting.Stenner developed auniversal theory about what causes intolerance of difference in general, which includes racism, political intolerance (e.g. restriction of free speech), moral intolerance (e.g. homophobia, supporting censorship, opposing abortion) and punitiveness. It demonstrates that all these seemingly disparate attitudes are principally caused by just two factors: individuals’ innate psychological predispositions to intolerance (“authoritarianism”) interacting with changing conditions of societal threat.Looked at this way, recent developments experienced by many voters as alarming — including the financial collapse of 2008, the surge of third-world immigration in the United States and Europe and continuing fears among traditionalists that the social order is under assault — have fueled authoritarianism:The threatening conditions, resonant particularly in the present political climate, that exacerbate authoritarian attitudes include at least the perception of civil dissent and unrest, loss of confidence in social institutions, unpopularity of leaders on both sides of politics, divisive presidential campaigns, internal or external crises that undermine national pride or confidence, national economic downturn and rapidly rising crime rates.The animosity between authoritarians and non-authoritarians has helped establish what Johnston, Lavine and Federico describe as the “expressive dimension” of policy choices:In this view, the influence of personality on economic opinion arises not because the expected outcomes of a policy match an individual’s traits, but because those traits resonate with the social meaning a policy has acquired.They explain further:Citizens care less about the outcomes a policy produces and more about the groups and symbols with which a policy is associated.Mason enlarged on this argument in her 2015 paper, “‘I Disrespectfully Agree’: The Differential Effects of Partisan Sorting on Behavioral and Issue Polarization.” Her argument is a direct challenge to those who take, as she puts it,an instrumental view of politics, in which people choose a party and decide how strongly to support it based solely on each party’s stated positions and whether the party shares interests with them.Instead, she writes,Contrary to an issue-focused view of political decision making and behavior, the results presented here suggest that political thought, behavior, and emotion are powerfully driven by political identities. The strength of a person’s identification with his or her party affects how biased, active, and angry that person is, even if that person’s issue positions are moderate.While much of this research uses the “preferred traits in child-rearing” questions to measure authoritarianism, two sociologists at the University of Kansas, David Norman Smith and Eric Hanley, observe in “The Anger Games: Who Voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 Election, and Why?” that those questions do not capture the full scope of authoritarianism, especially the more aggressive authoritarianism that they believe drives voters to Trump.Smith and Hanley used what they call a “domineering leader scale” to measurethe wish for a strong leader who will force others to submit. The premise is that evil is afoot; that money, the media and government authority — and even “politically correct” moral authority — have been usurped by undeserving interlopers. The desire for a domineering leader is the desire to see this evil crushed.The domineering leader scale is based on responses to two statements: “Our country will be great if we honor the ways of our forefathers, do what the authorities tell us to do, and get rid of the ‘rotten apples’ who are ruining everything” and “What our country really needs is a strong, determined leader who will crush evil and take us back to our true path.”If an aggressive, domineering authoritarianism is a prime motivator for many Trump supporters, as Smith and Hanley contend, the clash between Republicans and Democrats is likely to become more hostile and warlike.Federico, Feldman and Weber note thatsince the early 2000s, many especially acrimonious political debates have focused on threats to social stability and order — debates surrounding abortion, transgender rights, immigration, and the role of the federal government in protecting the rights of marginalized social groups.The rising “salience of these debates,” they write, “has contributed to a growing ‘authoritarian divide’ within the United States, at least among White Americans.”Trump has purposefully exacerbated the “many especially acrimonious political debates” now dominating public discourse, deepening not only the authoritarian divide, but the divide between open and closed mindedness, between acceptance and racial resentment, and between toleration of and aversion to change. He evidently believes that this is the best political strategy for presiding in the White House and winning re-election, but it is an extraordinarily destructive strategy for governing the country and for safeguarding America’s interests in the world.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONSAdvertisementSupported byAccording to subsequent studies, those polls substantially underestimated the number of Democratic white working-class voters — many of whom are culturally conservative — and overestimated the white college-educated Democratic electorate, a far more culturally liberal constituency.“The short answer is that the exit polls are wrong,” Matthew DeBell, a senior scholar at Stanford’s Institute for Research in the Social Sciences, emailed me. He continued:In November 2016, 31.9 percent of adult US citizens had college degrees, according to the Current Population Survey. There were 138.8 million votes. To reach 50 percent of all voters, the turnout rate among college grads would have to have been 97 percent. This doesn’t pass the laugh test; no credible study has ever found turnout rates that high.According to Pew, this noncollege white 33 percent makes up a larger bloc of the party’s voters than the 28 percent made up of racial and ethnic minorities without degrees. It is also larger than the 12 percent of Democratic voters made up of racial and ethnic minorities with college degrees.In sum, Pew’s more precise survey methods reveal that when Democrats are broken down by education, race and ethnicity, the white working class is the largest bloc of Democratic voters and substantially larger than the bloc of white college-educated Democratic voters.The Pew study, in contrast, found that the white working class cast 44 percent, or 60.1 million votes, of all the 2016 votes for president — 13.5 million more votes than in the Edison Research exit polls.At the same time, Pew found that whites with college degrees made up 30 percent of the total electorate, not the 37 percent reported in the exit polls. In other words, Pew found that white working-class voters outnumbered white college voters among all voters, while the exit polls reported just the opposite.These numbers have powerful ramifications for both Democrats and Republicans preparing for the 2018 and 2020 elections.The Center for American Progress study by Rob Griffin, Ruy Teixeira and John Halpin foundthat exit polls radically overestimated the share of white college-educated voters and radically underestimated the share of white non-college-educated voters. While the exit polls claimed that white college graduates actually outnumbered non-college-educated white voters at the polls in 2016, 37 to 34 percent, CAP’s data indicate a vastly different story: White college graduates were only about 29 percent of voters, while their non-college-educated counterparts far outdistanced them at 45 percent of voters.Edison exit polls taken on Nov. 8 had Clinton failing to carry college-educated whites, losing them to Trump (49-45). Pew found that she did in fact win these voters, decisively carrying white college grads, 55-38.According to the November exit polls, half of the entire 2016 electorate of all races had college degrees; Pew found that such well-educated voters were a much smaller 37 percent.“We are all circling around the absolute truth, but we are all using methodologies that have their problems,” he said. Asked if he thought Pew raised legitimate questions about the exit polling, especially on the shares of college and noncollege voters, Lenski said that all surveys “have their errors,” adding that there “are sampling errors, nonresponse errors.”Brian Schaffner, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, specializes in political polling. The major problem with exit polls, he wrote in an email, is thatit is very difficult to weight an exit poll to the target population, especially on the night of the election. The reason is that we don’t know yet what the electorate’s demographics will be when the voting is happening. The best that exit pollsters can do is record the approximate age, race, and gender of people who refuse to take the survey (based on what the exit pollster thinks they look like), but this only allows them to weight on three variables, and these factors aren’t even measured very precisely.The problems of the Edison exit polls are widely recognized in the political science community, but rarely discussed in the media. Robert Y. Shapiro, a political scientist at Columbia, noted that thebiases in the exit polls before they are weighted for the actual vote are well known — they have overrepresented Democratic voters and also now also the better educated who are more likely to vote Democratic.Christopher Achen, a political scientist at Princeton, wrote me:The exit polls have traditionally overrepresented college grads, and even more dramatically postgrads, probably because less-educated people are less inclined to respond to the interviewers unless they are particularly enthusiastic about a candidate and want to say so.He added that “when I read the Pew report, I thought it was very likely right.”Ted Brader, a political scientist at the University of Michigan, also emailed:the issue with the education distribution is that exit polls could provide, at best, a representative sample of those who turn out to vote, not a representative sample of the voting eligible US population.Such Election Day polling Brader wrote, is “intended for specific purposes that may not make them even a very good representative sample of those who voted.” Instead, Brader argued, exit polls are “organized principally by news organizations who want to be able to make election night ‘calls’ of winners as soon as they can, and also need to fill the airtime those evenings with commentary by talking heads.” The primary goal of exit polls, thus, “is not to provide a representative portrait of the whole electorate.”Because of their limitations, Brader wrote, “social scientists rarely turn to exit polls to study voting behavior.”Cohn argued that the exit polls overestimated “Trump’s support among well-educated white voters” and thatthere is no question that the exit polls underestimate the number of white working-class voters, especially older ones, by a considerable amount.Cohn observed that errors result from “an odd methodological quirk in exit polling” that “winds up biasing the rest of the survey because the exit polls are weighted to match the actual result of a far less educated country.” The net effect:The exit poll overestimates Republican support among most demographic groups, including well-educated white voters, and it overestimates the number of voters from Democratic-leaning voting blocs, like young, nonwhite and well-educated voters.Assuming this critique of the exit polls is correct, what are the implications for Democrats and Republicans?For Democrats, the Pew and CAP calculations suggest that because the noncollege white vote remains highly significant, the party and its candidates need to prevent any further erosion in this constituency that went so strongly for Trump.The corollary for Republicans is that the party, already behind in the popular vote, cannot afford to suffer continued losses among college-educated white voters, especially college-educated women. Pew found by 2017, a year into the Trump presidency:Voters who have completed college make up a third of all registered voters. And a majority — 58 percent — of all voters with at least a four-year college degree now identifies as Democrats or leans Democratic, the highest share dating back to 1992. Just 36 percent affiliate with the Republican Party or lean toward the G.O.P.This danger has become more acute, according to the Pew study:The share of women identifying as Democrats or leaning Democratic is up 4 percentage points since 2015 and is at one of its highest points since 1992.At the same time, though, Trump appears to be strengthening Republican support among noncollege whites:Voters with no college experience have been moving toward the GOP: 47 percent identify with or lean toward the Republican Party, up from 42 percent in 2014.The Pew and CAP studies received relatively little publicity compared to the massive coverage of the exit polls, raising the question of how much the political community will adjust to the conflicting data.Michael McDonald, a political scientist at the University of Florida who studies the intricacies of polling, is not optimistic:In real time on election night, the exit polls set a narrative, and for a long time there is no other data that changes that narrative, and that narrative solidifies into place and it’s really hard to get past it.Polling that provides an inaccurate picture of the electorate does more than undermine partisan strategy and media analysis. Trevor Tompson, vice president of NORC (formerly the National Opinion Research Center) at the University of Chicago, emailed me:The overrepresentation of college-educated voters, and especially those with postgraduate degrees, has long been a known issue with the in-person exit poll.He then added:The bottom line is we need to have much better data for the health of our democracy.For Democrats, these questions are a matter of competitive survival.Teixeira of the Center for American Politics and William Galston of The Brookings Institution, two longtime Democratic strategists, suggest different but complementary directions in which to take the Democratic Party going forward.“No issue has done more than immigration to feed populism, and finding a sustainable compromise would drain much of the bile from today’s politics,” Galston writes. He continues:Defenders of liberal democracy should acknowledge that controlling borders is a legitimate exercise of sovereignty, and that the appropriate number and type of immigrants is a legitimate subject for debate. Denouncing citizens concerned about immigration as bigots ameliorates neither the substance nor the politics of the problem. There’s nothing illiberal about the view that too many immigrants stress a country’s capacity to absorb them, so that a reduction or even a pause may be in order.she would have carried, with robust margins, the states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Iowa, as well as Florida and Ohio. In fact, if Clinton could simply have reduced the shift toward Donald Trump among these voters by one-quarter, she would have won.In Alabama’s special Senate election, Doug Jones, the winning Democrat, would have lost if he had not made substantial inroads with the white working class, Teixeira argued:Without the hefty swing among the white non-college population, particularly women, there is no way Jones would have won the state, or even come close.Teixeira concluded:There is no way around it — if Democrats hope to be competitive in Ohio and similar states in 2020, they must do the hard thing: find a way to reach hearts and minds among white non-college voters.In many respects, these two groups of white voters see the world very differently. For example, 54 percent of college-educated whites think that America’s culture and way of life have improved since the 1950s; 62 percent of white working-class Americans think that it has changed for the worse. Sixty-eight percent of working-class whites, but only 47 percent of college-educated whites, believe that the American way of life needs to be protected against foreign influences. Sixty-six percent of working-class whites, but only 43 percent of college-educated whites, say that discrimination against whites has become as big a problem as discrimination against blacks and other minorities. In a similar vein, 62 percent of working-class whites believe that discrimination against Christians has become as big a problem as discrimination against other groups, a proposition only 38 percent of college educated whites endorse.This brings us to the issue of immigration. By a margin of 52 to 35 percent, college-educated whites affirm that today’s immigrants strengthen our country through their talent and hard work. Conversely, 61 percent of white working-class voters say that immigrants weaken us by taking jobs, housing, and health care. Seventy-one percent of working-class whites think that immigrants mostly hurt the economy by driving down wages, a belief endorsed by only 44 percent of college-educated whites. Fifty-nine percent of working-class whites believe that we should make a serious effort to deport all illegal immigrants back to their home countries; only 33 percent of college-educated whites agree. Fifty-five percent of working-class whites think we should build a wall along our border with Mexico, while 61 percent of whites with BAs or more think we should not. Majorities of working-class whites believe that we should make the entry of Syrian refugees into the United States illegal and temporarily ban the entrance of non-American Muslims into our country; about two-thirds of college-educated whites oppose each of these proposals.Opinions on trade follow a similar pattern. By a narrow margin of 48 to 46 percent, college-educated whites endorse the view that trade agreements are mostly helpful to the United States because they open up overseas markets while 62 percent of working-class whites believe that they are harmful because they send jobs overseas and drive down wages.It is understandable that working-class whites are more worried that they or their families will become victims of violent crime than are whites with more education. After all, they are more likely to live in neighborhoods with higher levels of social disorder and criminal behavior. It is harder to explain why they are also much more likely to believe that their families will fall victim to terrorism. To be sure, homegrown terrorist massacres of recent years have driven home the message that it can happen to anyone, anywhere. We still need to explain why working-class whites have interpreted this message in more personal terms.The most plausible interpretation is that working-class whites are experiencing a pervasive sense of vulnerability. On every front — economic, cultural, personal security — they feel threatened and beleaguered. They seek protection against all the forces they perceive as hostile to their cherished way of life — foreign people, foreign goods, foreign ideas, aided and abetted by a government they no longer believe cares about them. Perhaps this is why fully 60 percent of them are willing to endorse a proposition that in previous periods would be viewed as extreme: the country has gotten so far off track that we need a leader who is prepared to break some rules if that is what it takes to set things right.The bottom line, as the 2016 election amply demonstrated, is that if the Democratic Party does not take the bull by the horns, someone else will.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONSAdvertisementSupported byOver the next six months, Democratic voters will be asked again and again whether their party’s candidates should hew to the center or move to the left.“Every Democrat, like every American, should support a woman’s right to make her own choices about her body and her health,” Perez said in a statement. “That is not negotiable and should not change city by city or state by state.” Perez later backed off.No matter who won, the district was expected to stay in Democratic hands in the general election.The more significant election in the Democrats’ strategic debate was the widely publicized special election victory last week of Conor Lamb, a moderate Democrat, in a mostly white, working-to-middle class western Pennsylvania congressional district.Lamb’s success in flipping a hard-core Republican electorate placed the choice facing Democrats running for president and those running for House and Senate in swing districts and states front and center: Does the path to victory lie in mobilizing the liberal base — by taking explicitly left-wing stands on immigration, as well as gun rights, universal health care, the minimum wage, racial justice and so on?Or is the widespread hatred of Donald Trump — at least among Democrats — sufficient to turn out progressive and minority voters, which would make undecideds the constituency that must be more actively wooed?Lamb pointedly strayed from Democratic orthodoxy on the Second Amendment, minimum wage and Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs. His willingness to break with his party on those issues was crucial to his victory. As a decorated veteran, Lamb muted Democratic liabilities on military issues.By winning a district that Trump had carried by 20 percentage points, Lamb set off a national debate.There are a lot of Conor Lambs out there. Very early in the election cycle, Democrats recruited candidates with nontraditional backgrounds, especially in the military, who would appeal to voters in red districts.“The real message of Lamb’s campaign basically boiled down to this: ‘Look at what a fine young normal white fellow I am!’ ” Moser wrote. The “clamor for centrism,” according to Moser, risksdeflating the Resistance, turning off nonwhite voters, and dampening the turnout that Democrats should be able to expect in November, given the level of Trump animus across the country.This intraparty struggle will not be resolved on the merits. It will be hammered out by strategists and candidates over the next two and a half years and will ultimately be decided by Democratic primary voters. The evidence suggests that the balance of power among these voters is shifting to the left.In 1976, conservative Democrats were a significant force within the party, making up 27 percent of its supporters. By 1992, their share fell to 24 percent, still a factor to be reckoned with, providing a crucial source of support to Bill Clinton.By 2012 — the last year for which the authors have data — conservative Democrats had been marginalized in primaries, reduced to 7 percent.Over the latter third of the 20th century, Hill and Tausanovitch write,conservatives sorted into the Republican primary, liberals sorted into the Democratic primary, and centrists began turning out at somewhat lower rates in primary elections.These trends are illustrated in the accompanying graphics for 1976, 1992 and 2012. Each chart breaks the electorate into deciles: the first decile, on the left, is the most liberal; the tenth, on the right, the most conservative.I asked Tausanovitch what the implications were for moderate Democrats looking at 2018 and 2020:Clearly the Democratic primary electorate is more extreme in recent elections than in 1992. This appears to be the result of party sorting: liberals are more likely to be Democrats, and conservatives are more likely to be Republicans than in the past.If primary voters choose the candidate that most closely reflects their views, then there isn’t much hope for a more moderate Democrat.There are a substantial number of Democrats, especially among party officials, activists and consultants, who believe that candidates, especially at the presidential level, need to stake out centrist positions and avoid the perception of being in lock step with liberal interest groups.It means that being a calm, thoughtful and polite moderate is a winning strategy once more.Glickman and his centrist allies are, however, likely to be drowned out by the vociferous opposition to this idea.Bartels determined that Democrats are close to united in their support of an activist government that reduces the gap between rich and poor, regulates the environment and insures access to health care.Still, according to Bartels, cultural issues sow discord among Democrats. While more than a quarter of Democratic voters, 26.3 percent, are “closer to the Republicans than to their fellow Democrats” on cultural attitudes, nearly three quarters of Democrats, 73.9 percent, are more liberal on cultural issues.In an email, Bartels described these culturally liberal Democrats as:relatively more enthusiastic about atheists, gays and lesbians, and Muslims; more negative about Fox News, Walmart, and Christians; more willing to rely on “experts”; less likely to say that “anyone who is willing to work hard can still achieve the American dream”; more likely to deny that “the interests of ethnic and racial minority groups often conflict with those of the white majority”; less “authoritarian” (as measured by questions about child-rearing), further to the left in their ideological self-placements, and more pro-choice on abortion.According to Bartels, Democrats who are most firmly culturally liberal are overwhelmingly white.I exchanged emails with a Democratic consultant who has played a prominent role in presidential, Senate and House elections. He asked to remain anonymous in order to be more candid.The first question I posed was: Could Lamb — who did not face a primary — have won the seat if the contest had been held in 2016, during a general election? The answer was no:We know that PA-18 was not winnable in a year with Hillary at the top of the ticket. Democrats did not win any seat with the demographic profile of this one anywhere in the country in 2016 — save for handful of longtime incumbents.How about 2020? Could a centrist like Bill Clinton get the nomination?I’d say the answer is “no.” I think the politics of the Democratic Party have changed significantly since that time and while it may not be the MOST liberal candidate who wins the nomination, all viable candidates will have to pass a certain threshold of liberal-ness.One of the best case studies of center-left intraparty schism can be seen in the upcoming May 22 runoff election for the Democratic nomination in the 7th Congressional District in Texas — upscale suburban Houston.She is a Washington insider, who begrudgingly moved to Houston to run for Congress. In fact, she wrote in Washingtonian magazine, “I’d rather have my teeth pulled out without anesthesia” than live in Texas. As of January 2018, she claimed Washington, D.C. to be her primary residence in order to get a tax break.The district has been in Republican hands for 52 years, since George H.W. Bush first won the seat in 1966. In the 2016 election, however, Hillary Clinton beat Trump there, 49-47, abruptly putting the 10-term Republican incumbent, John Culberson, high on the Democrats’ target list.To bring this full circle, the upscale 7th District in Texas and the downscale 18th District in Pennsylvania effectively represent the dilemma of a party increasingly dominated by cultural liberals.In Texas, that may not prove a liability. Both Moser and Fletcher are on the left on predominantly cultural issues like immigration, gun rights and gay rights. Those positions are clearly becoming more acceptable among affluent, college-educated voters, a constituency in which Democrats have been making steady gains.It is in less well-to-do places like Conor Lamb’s Pennsylvania 18 — where 32.9 percent have a college degree or higher and the median household income of $58,600. Among Lamb’s constituents, cultural liberalism is, consequently, a liability — even fatal, electorally speaking.To nominate candidates who, like Lamb, are equipped to win working and middle class swing districts in the general election will require Democratic primary voters to cast strategic rather than ideological ballots — focusing on who can prevail in November, in 2018 but also in 2020. And, perhaps more to the point, Democratic donors will have to decide whether they can back candidates who agree with them 80 percent but not 99 percent of the time.At a moment when Trump has exacerbated polarization, persuading leaders and voters on the left flank of the Democratic Party to think tactically about the 2020 presidential primaries is crucial but problematic. Insofar as Democrats place a higher priority on purity than viability, they may be risking an indeterminate extension of the Trump era.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONSAdvertisementSupported byTrump’s purpose is clear. He seeks to weaken an institution that serves to constrain the abusive exercise of executive authority. He has initiated a gladiatorial contest pitting the principle of freedom of the press against a principle of his own invention: freedom from the press.Rosen observed that the history of right-wing attacks on the mediaThere is an underlying strategy to Trump’s critique of the media. Rosen continued:Trump is not just attacking the press but the conditions that make it possible for news reports to serve as any kind of check on power. Trump is the apotheosis of this history and its accelerant. He has advanced the proposition dramatically. From undue influence (Agnew’s claim) to something closer to treason (enemy of the people.) Instead of criticizing ‘the media’ for unfair treatment, he whips up hatred for it. Some of his most demagogic performances have been exactly that. Nixon seethed about the press in private. Trump seethes in public, a very different act.The media, on the other hand, enters the fray with significant disadvantages.The Trump administration, with a rhetoric that began during the campaign and burgeoned in the earliest days of Donald Trump’s presidency, has engaged in enemy construction of the press, and the risks that accompany that categorization are grave.Insofar as Trump succeeds in “undercutting the watchdog, educator, and proxy functions of the press,” they write, itleaves the administration more capable of delegitimizing other institutions and constructing other enemies — including the judiciary, the intelligence community, immigrants, and members of certain races or religions.Jones and Sun contend that in many respects, Trump is reminiscent of Richard M. Nixon:Nixon, like Trump, accused the media of being out to get him and predicted that the press would mischaracterize his public support or the reception he received. He believed the liberal media to be biased against him personally, maintaining that he had “entered the presidency with less support from the major publications and TV networks than any president in history” and that “their whole objective in life is to bring us down.”routinely reaffirmed to both the press and the public that he conceived of the press as central to democracy. Indeed, in his first speech to the public regarding the Watergate scandal, Nixon acknowledged that “the system that brought the facts to light and that will bring those guilty to justice” was a system that included “a vigorous free press.”Trump stands out, according to Jones and Sun, in that his administrationhas passed a threshold not approached by previous administrations in their tensions with the media. Trump is signaling — through his terminology, through his delegitimizing actions, and through his anticipatory undercutting — that the press is literally the enemy, to be distrusted, ignored, and excluded.In response to my email, Jones replied that “war has been declared, whether they (the media) like it or not.” She noted that the instincts of the pressmotivate it to want to call out the changing norms that it sees around it, and to defend the role of important democratic institutions when they are attacked. But when the press is itself one of those institutions, it finds itself a part of the story in ways that it is unaccustomed to being, and it has to weigh the potential loss of credibility that might come with an aggressive self-defense.“The best way for the press to react to Trump’s undemocratic behavior is to continue trying to do their jobs the best they can,” Ladd wrote. “The press is not perfect, but Trump’s bad behavior doesn’t change what they need to do.”Ladd specifically warned against “reacting to Trump by becoming more crusadingly anti-Trump.”If the media directly address the accusations of fake news, they ironically run the risk of dignifying the accusations. But if they ignore the accusations, they miss the opportunity to prove their professionalism to those who have grown skeptical.In the long term, Stone suggested, we could begin to remedy this problem if we improved civic education and encouraged a stronger defense of the media by politicians, especially Republicans — a prospect about which he is not optimistic.Of the media itself, however, Stone wrote:I don’t know that there’s really much they can do to defend themselves. Those who trust them will continue to trust them. Those who distrust them are unlikely to be brought around by anything they themselves are likely to say.Trump’s disdain for the First Amendment is an integral part of a much longer series of developments in which both parties have demonstrated a willingness to defy democratic norms, although the Republican Party has been in the forefront.For a quarter of a century, Republican officials have been more willing than Democratic officials to play constitutional hardball — not only or primarily on judicial nominations but across a range of spheres. Democrats have also availed themselves of hardball throughout this period, but not with the same frequency or intensity.Fishkin and Pozen cite the work of Mark Tushnet, a professor at Harvard Law School, to define constitutional hardball as “political claims and practices”that are without much question within the bounds of existing constitutional doctrine and practice but that are nonetheless in some tension with existing pre-constitutional understandings. Constitutional hardball tactics are viewed by the other side as provocative and unfair because they flout the ‘goes without saying’ assumptions that underpin working systems of constitutional government. Such tactics do not generally flout binding legal norms. But that only heightens the sense of foul play insofar as it insulates acts of hardball from judicial review.Republicans on the far right, in particular, Fishkin and Pozen write, have been willing to engage in constitutional hardball because they are drawn to “narratives of debasement and restoration,” which suggestthat something has gone fundamentally awry in the republic, on the order of an existential crisis, and that unpatriotic liberals have allowed or caused it to happen.The severity of the liberal threat, in the eyes of these conservatives, justifies extreme steps to restore what they see as a besieged moral order.In an email, Fishkin wrote:As with so many things about President Trump, it strikes me that he didn’t start the fire. He got into office because it was already burning and now he’s pouring on gasoline.In Fishkin’s view, Trump will do all he can to make the conflict between his party and the press “sharper and more intense, in the same way that he depends on and aims to intensify partisan polarization.”Pozen warned in an email:Accusations that the press has a political agenda can, perversely, help create an agenda which is then said to corroborate the accusations.to lock up one’s general election opponent, encouraging online hate mobs, lying constantly, attacking the press constantly, contradicting oneself constantly, undermining the very idea of truth are individually and in common potentially profound threats to the integrity and quality of our system of free expression.The question is whether the news media can mount an effective check on the exercise of power when the media itself has become an object of hatred for a large segment of the electorate.Rosen of N.Y.U. notes the cross pressures on the news media:I think our top journalists are correct that if they become the political opposition to Trump, and see themselves that way, they lose. But they have to go to war against a political style in which power gets to write its own story.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONSAdvertisementSupported byHostility to the opposition party and its candidates has now reached a level where loathing motivates voters more than loyalty.The building strength of partisan antipathy — “negative partisanship” — has radically altered politics. Anger has become the primary tool for motivating voters. Ticket splitting is dying out. But perhaps the most important consequence of the current power of political anger is that there has been a marked decline in the accountability of public officials to the electorate.We find that as animosity toward the opposing party has intensified, it has taken on a new role as the prime motivator in partisans’ political lives.Iyengar and Krupenkin argue thatthe impact of feelings toward the out-party on both vote choice and the decision to participate has increased since 2000; today it is out-group animus rather than in-group favoritism that drives political behavior.one of the most important trends in American politics over the past several decades has been the rise of negative partisanship in the electorate.To a greater extent than at any time in the post-World War II era, the outcomes of elections below the presidential level reflect the outcomes of presidential elections. As a result, the famous comment by the late Tip O’Neill that “all politics is local” now seems rather quaint. In the 21st century United States, it increasingly appears that all politics is national.The practice of voting against rather than for has grown steadily since the 2000 election, but it reached new heights in 2016, when both major party nominees were viewed substantially more negatively than positively.Abramowitz and Webster compiled data from the 2012 and 2016 elections to show how much the level of anger among both Democratic and Republican voters increased over four years.In 2012, 33 percent of Democrats and 43 percent of Republicans described themselves as angry at the opposing party’s presidential candidate “most of the time” or “just about always.” In 2016, the percentage of Democratic voters who said they were this angry at Trump rose to 73 percent, and the percentage of Republicans with that level of hostility toward Hillary Clinton rose to 66 percent.From one vantage point, the view of each major party has steadily worsened. As Abramowitz and Webster point out:The percentage of Americans with favorable opinions of both parties is now the lowest it has been since the American National Election Studies began asking this question in 1978.At the same time, “record numbers of voters in 2016 were dissatisfied with their own party’s presidential nominee.” Trump and Clintonwere the most unpopular major party candidates for president since the ANES introduced the feeling thermometer scale in 1968.The accompanying graphic shows that both Democrats and Republicans had favorable views of their own candidates from 1968 to 2012, ranging from 76.5 percent in 1968 to 78.5 percent in 2012. In 2016, however, with Trump and Clinton as the nominees, the thermometer rating dropped sharply to 60.9 percent.Over the same period, “feeling thermometer” ratings of the opposition candidate fell sharply, from 56.2 in 1968 to 25.1 in 2012. In 2016, the ratings of the opposition candidate plummeted to 12.2.Despite the public’s increasingly adverse views of political parties, party loyalty in voting has now reached record levels, according to the two authors. Partisanship currently “has a stronger influence on vote choice than at any time since the 1950s.”How can these conflicting trends be reconciled? Voters dislike the parties and are dissatisfied with their candidates, even as they cast straight-ticket ballots. This may sound inconsistent, but it’s not that hard to understand.According to Abramowitz and Webster, in 2016, “large majorities of Democrats and Republicans truly despised the opposing party’s nominee.” Voters were motivated to go to the polls to cast ballots against the opposition’s nominee much more than to support their own party’s choice. The key factor “in predicting party loyalty in the 2016 presidential election was how voters felt about the opposing party’s presidential candidate.”In fact, Abramowitz and Webster found that “this measure was twice as important in predicting loyalty as feelings toward the candidate from one’s own party.” Partisan loyalty remained “very high because both Democratic and Republican identifiers overwhelmingly viewed the opposing party’s candidate with deep hostility.”In the 1970s, about a quarter of all voters split their tickets, voting for presidential and congressional candidates of different parties. Now, not even one in 10 does so. The result:In 2016, all 34 Senate elections and 400 of 435 U.S. House elections were won by the party winning the presidential election in the state or district.In their analysis of negative partisanship, Iyengar and Krupenkin argue that voting on the basis of hostility has an unexpected consequence: It lessens pressure on the winner to be accountable to his or her supporters, effectively freeing winners to thumb their noses at many of the voters who put them in office:When citizens’ support for a candidate stems primarily from their strong dislike for the opposing candidate, they are less subject to the logic of accountability. Their psychic satisfaction comes more from defeating and humiliating the out-group, and less from any performance or policy benefits that might accrue from the victory of the in-party. For this group of voters, candidates have every incentive to inflame partisan negativity, further entrenching affective polarization.By this logic, Iyengar and Krupenkin argue thatIf partisans care less about their own party’s performance and instead focus on their distrust of the opposition party, elected officials no longer need campaign on their own merits; instead, they have good reason to try even harder to denigrate the opposition.In other words, Trump critics who anticipate a collapse of support when he fails to deliver on campaign promises are likely to be disappointed. According to Iyengar and Krupenkin,The primal sense of “us against them” makes partisans fixate on the goal of defeating and even humiliating the opposition at all costs. This negativity bias in voting behavior undermines traditional theories of electoral accountability that rest on incumbents’ ability to deliver policy and performance benefits.Candidates and incumbents, Iyengar and Krupenkin continue, “are less likely to be sanctioned for demonstrating incompetence, dishonesty and unethical behavior.”What explains the extraordinary level of support for Moore, not only from Republican voters but also from the larger population of white Alabamians, at 68 percent, and conservatives, at 83 percent?The authors found that just as the Democratic Party is often described as a collection of identity groups, identity politics have also become a powerful force within the Republican Party. They argue, in fact, that “this effect is more powerful among Republicans than among Democrats, due to the general social homogeneity of the Republican Party,” with the result that “Republicans are more susceptible to identity-based politics.” For Republicans,the general white, Christian conservative alliance with the party led to a far simpler categorization of who is in the group and who is outside of it.Why would this lead to more willingness to vote for someone with as much baggage as Roy Moore? The convergence of voter identification with voters’ social identity — conservative, white, Christian — “makes in-party preference more powerful and out-party tolerance ever more difficult.”Put another way, Republican doubts about Roy Moore were superseded by hatred of the Democratic Party.There is no sign that the growth in negative polarization will slow down, much less reverse itself. The dominant incentive in politics right now is to capitalize on animosity to the opposition party.At a time when true swing voters have become a smaller and smaller share of the electorate, hatred, anger and animosity have proven the most effective tools to mobilize support.By email, I asked Webster and Iyengar the following question: “Does negative partisanship override polarization on issues of race, sex, immigration, feminism, traditional family structure, LGBT issues, military spending and policy, etc.?”Webster replied:I’d be more inclined to say that negative partisanship has helped to perpetuate and exacerbate the degree of partisan polarization that we have in the U.S.Iyengar contended that “affective divergence exceeds policy-related divergence.” A more “ ‘primal’ view of partisanship” has been gaining strength among social scientists, he wrote, noting the discoverythat children acquired a sense of party identification quite early in the life cycle without any “flickering awareness” of party differences on the issues. Moreover, as people moved through the life cycle, with corresponding changes in economic circumstances and interests, their sense of partisanship was unmoved despite considerable change in their stances on the issues.Today, sizable shares of both Democrats and Republicans say the other party stirs feelings of not just frustration, but fear (56 percent of Democrats, 49 percent of Republicans) and anger (47 percent Democrats, 46 percent Republicans).Not only do almost half of Republicans say Democrats are lazier than other Americans, more dishonest (45 percent), more closed-minded (52 percent) and more immoral (47 percent), most (59 percent) also say the members of their own party are more hard-working.The Pew findings offer little comfort to those seeking concord. Some 70 percent of Democrats “say that Republicans are more closed-minded than other Americans.” Four out of ten Democrats say “Republicans are more dishonest,” and a third say Republicans are immoral and unintelligent.Each party holds negative, stereotypical images of the other stemming from the need to justify the deeds of hostility. The negative and simplified stereotypes are needed in order to simplify the conflict excluding discoveries of similarities between the groups in conflict. The individuals in intergroup conflict systematically tend to misperceive each other to accentuate differences. The resulting images tend to perpetuate negative stereotypes of each other containing oversimplified, inaccurate and derogatory beliefs concerning the other group that are identified as the enemies.Just as adversaries are denigrated, allies are praised:The image of self, in contrast, reflects glorification of everyone who is alike. A mirror image emerges in which each party sees the other one negatively and itself positively. On the basis of the overgeneralized difference stemming from the categorization into in-group and out-group, the group members in each group necessarily will be pushed into the labyrinth of cognitive biases which are the cornerstones of the hostile image of the other.consider the other side as entirely criminal and inhuman, as totally worthless. Otherwise they are themselves criminal and inhuman. The logic of value and its obverse, worthlessness, unfolds its annihilating consequence, compelling ever new, ever deeper discriminations, criminalizations, and devaluations to the point of annihilating all of unworthy life.It is not too much to say that a significant number of voters in both of America’s major political parties see their adversaries as worthless. And history teaches us that the logic of worthlessness has chilling implications.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONSAdvertisementWhen they zig, he zags.Cardi B will co-host “The Tonight Show” with Jimmy Fallon next Monday night, the first time the show has ever had two people sharing hosting duties, NBC said on Tuesday.Next Monday’s show will, as usual, stand out compared to his competitors: Mr. Fallon has kept his show joke-and-celebrity heavy while CBS’s Stephen Colbert and ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel have gotten increasingly political.

In virtually every detail, Trump seems like the perfect manifestation of postmodernism.Along parallel lines, Ernst wrote,if the only one true thing in the world is that all truth and morality are relative, then anyone who pretends otherwise is either an idiot or a fraud. Hence the contemporary appeal of the antihero, and the disappearance of the traditional hero.Call it what you want: relativism, constructivism, deconstruction, postmodernism, critique. The idea is the same: Truth is not found, but made, and making truth means exercising power.It is not usually the job of political journalists to analyze postmodernism, so I turned to some scholars who are devoted to the subject.are not socially constructed but emerge from his own personal sense of what will promote his popularity, his power, and his wealth. This is why his particular, and acute, narcissism is so dangerous: he appeals to no social standards at all, only his own imagination as to what is in his own personal interest.I don’t think Trump should be called a postmodern president, but simply a liar.For something to be objectively true, Oksala wrote,does not mean that we have to have (or can have) absolute and eternally infallible knowledge of it. But our knowledge claims have to be available for public scrutiny by the scientific community and go through a rigorous peer-review process in order to qualify as scientific or objective truths.In the present political climate truth and power have become uncoupled to a certain extent. It’s natural to wonder whether this means the notion of objective truth has been undermined. But it could be the opposite, namely, that what we’re living through isn’t the loss of the category of objective truth but rather a battle over who has objective truth on their side. In other words, the very category of objective truth has become an ideological weapon, having been displaced from relatively neutral territory to the political battlefield.In philosophy, the dominant idea was probably Jean-Francois Lyotard’s view that we are at “the end of grand narratives,” the end of the idea that our history or our world or our existence can be accounted for by a single overarching narrative that accounts for it (or them).We are the species that discovered doubt. Is there enough food laid by for winter? Have I miscalculated? Is my mate cheating on me? Should we have moved south? Is it safe to enter this cave?Dennett adamantly rejects “a slide into some form of relativism.” He argues that while “it is true that past scientific orthodoxies have themselves inspired policies that hindsight reveals to be seriously flawed” and that “the methods of science aren’t foolproof,” it is also true thatthey are indefinitely perfectible. Just as important: there is a tradition of criticism that enforces improvement whenever and wherever flaws are discovered. The methods of science, like everything else under the sun, are themselves objects of scientific scrutiny, as method becomes methodology, the analysis of methods.Trump’s utter indifference to the truth, what some of his critics have come to call his “normlessness,” is intensely alarming to many Washington analysts.who aroused such grave and widespread doubts about his commitment to the institutions of self-government, to the norms democracy requires, to the legitimacy of opposition in a free republic, and to the need for basic knowledge about major policy questions and about how government works.They continue:Norms, we argue, are often more important than formal rules in ensuring the function of a constitutional republic.Observing that “Trump has violated these basic understandings of how our democracy works in an unprecedented way,” Dionne, Mann and Ornstein go on:This norm breaking, is not simply a matter of political nicety. It is part of Trump’s larger assault on our institutions, his tendency to think in autocratic terms, his abusive attitude toward the judicial system, and his disrespect for civil servants and the day-to-day work of government. We show how Trump’s words and behavior parallel those of authoritarian leaders, past and present.Wealth, according to Durkheim,deceives us into believing that we depend on ourselves only. Reducing the resistance we encounter from objects, it suggests the possibility of unlimited success against them. The less limited one feels, the more intolerable all limitation appears.Trump’s status and wealth have allowed him to ignore limits, norms, rules and regulations and have created a vicious circle — as violations of customary norms go unpunished, such violations become ever more widespread.The “modern” in “postmodern” refers to the idea that we should seek truth by the objective methods of reason and science — not by appeals to emotion or tradition. ‘Postmodern’ is often used to refer to those who think there is no objective truth, just various devices we use to con people into agreeing with us. In this sense, Trump is postmodern.For Foucault, Trump, who seeks not truth but only power, would be an extreme example of what serious postmodernism opposes.a strain in postmodernism was so giddily determined to call into question the posturing of Enlightenment scientism that its advocates recklessly dismissed the very existence of objective truths.To these earlier advocates of postmodernism,everything is just the game of power, they noisily declared, assuring themselves that their deconstructive claims would somehow always be in the service of radical critique.This view, however, “was eviscerated by philosophers like Bernard Williams and has, I think, virtually no current standing.”academic skepticism about objective truth doesn’t as a rule deny that we can know the fact of the matter — e.g. the answer to the question “How many German troops crossed bridges over the Rhine on March 7, 1936?” Or “By how many degrees did the average global temperature rise between 1987 and 2017?”Instead, Bromwich argues that academic skepticismis directed against the assumption that any particular interpretation of the facts should be trusted as quite reliable.These movements in theoretical analysis are, however, alien to Trump, Bromwich wrote:Anyway, none of it was required to create Trump’s attitude toward fact and truth. He seems a demagogue of a familiar modern type, but far less coherent and more capricious than most of his predecessors.In the transcript, Muir and Trump go back and forth for 1,168 words — an eternity on television — until Trump acknowledges how he justifies the claim: “You know what’s important, millions of people agree with me.” Trump told Muir that people called in to say, “ ‘We agree with Mr. Trump. We agree.’ They’re very smart people.”The Muir interview provides evidence in support of a thesis developed by Carlos Prado, professor emeritus of philosophy at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario. Prado argues that instead of representing postmodernism, Trump embodies a very different phenomenon: “Post-Truth.”“Users of post-truth see themselves as expressing their opinions, but opinions that call for no verification, and in being their opinions, are on a par with anyone else’s opinions,” Prado writes in a forthcoming book, “The New Subjectivism”:Post-truth is the final step in the misguided move away from objective truth to relativization of truth. If truth is objective, assertions or propositions are true depending on how things are. If truth is relative, assertions or propositions are true depending on how people take things to be.“The criticism of postmodern theory as ‘anything goes relativism’ is a bum rap,” says John Caputo, emeritus professor of religion at Syracuse University:In postmodern theory we are better served by the idea of having ‘good reasons,’ meaning the best idea that anybody has at the moment, remembering that some obscure fellow working in a patent office because he can’t find a job teaching physics is liable to change the face of physics tomorrow morning.The problem with Trump, according to Caputo,is not that he is an “anything goes relativist,” but that he is an authoritarian, a would-be strong man, who launches vile personal attacks on anyone who criticizes him.anyone would be inclined to blame intellectual trends in the academy or in the arts for the way that Trump speaks, thinks, or acts. Given that he does not read very much at all, and that the kind of literary and social theory you reference depends on reading closely, the two trends could not be further apart.As a result, Koopman continued in an email,only those who are cynical about truth itself can take him seriously. His style is not “postmodern” at all, but is rather cynical.If postmodernism does not account for Trump’s bludgeoning of the truth, what does? A field that provides insight into the Trump phenomenon is evolutionary theory.The answer lies in raw tribalism: when someone is perceived as a champion of one’s coalition, all is forgiven. The same is true for opinions: a particular issue can become a sacred value, shibboleth, or affirmation of allegiance to one’s team, and its content no longer matters. This is part of a growing realization in political psychology that tribalism has been underestimated in our understanding of politics, and ideological coherence and political and scientific literacy overestimated.Once tribalism becomes embedded in the political system, Pinker wrote,the full ingenuity of human cognition is recruited to valorize the champion and shore up the sacred beliefs. You can always dismiss criticism as being motivated by the bias of one’s enemies. Our cognitive and linguistic faculties are endlessly creative — that’s what makes our species so smart — and that creativity can be always deployed to reframe issues in congenial or invidious terms.Don Symons, professor of anthropology emeritus at the University of California-Santa Barbara, made a similar point in an email:Our species is profoundly coalitional, and in most times and places moral prescriptions apply only to one’s in-group, not to humanity in general. I don’t see any evidence that we evolved innate, universal moral rules about how to treat all humans. That’s why history, as James Joyce said, is a nightmare. Prehistory is worse. I assume that coalitional-thinking is what Trump was getting at when he claimed that he could shoot someone on 5th Avenue and his base would still love him. It’s not that they feel that killing a random stranger for no reason is morally ok; it’s that loyalty to their coalition leader is primary.If tribalism has begun to supplant traditional partisanship, their argument suggests, lying in politics will metastasize as traditional constraints continue to fall by the wayside.Trump’s success, such as it is, has been to accelerate the ongoing transformation of traditional political competition into an atavistic struggle in which each side claims moral superiority and defines the opposition as evil.These developments have been unfolding for decades, but the 2016 election was a turning point that appears to have the potential to corrupt the system beyond repair. Trump is determined to leave the destruction of democratic procedure as his legacy. Instead of granting him the title of postmodernist, let’s say instead that Trump is a nihilist who seeks to trample, to trash, to blight, to break and to burn.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONSAdvertisementIt raised the question of when the first A-list star would insist on one in his or her own contract.That still hasn’t happened.

These haphazard lines are fundamentally unfair and inefficient, and invite tax planning by sophisticated taxpayers to get within the preferred categories.Glogower, Kamin, Kysar, and Shanske argue that some of the most egregious loopholes and schemes permitted by the legislation are that individual taxpayerswill be able to shield their labor income from tax by simply setting up a corporation and having their income accrue in the form of corporate profits. As a result, income that would have been taxed at the high individual rates is instead taxed at the low corporate rate.Second, the legislation creates a huge incentive for anyone in a position to do so to change his or her status from employee to “independent contractor or a partner in a firm. The game is clear: Don’t be an employee, instead be an independent contractor or partner in a firm.” The ability to make this shift is available primarily to the well-paid.The legislation, according to Glogower and his colleagues, also fails to present a coherent rationale:the fundamental problem is the lack of any underlying logic in deciding who benefits from the pass-through deductions, and who does not. Independent contractors and partners benefit, but not employees. Why? An owner of real estate through a REIT benefits, but not the doctor in the building. Why? An architect benefits in some ways that a lawyer does not. And so on.The bill encourages tax evasion. Glogower and his colleagues citeopportunities to use rate differentials and ill-considered transitions to engage in transactions that serve to basically pump money out of the Treasury and into the pockets of well-advised taxpayers.To provide an example, they use a company that purchased equipment under existing law, which provides them with tax breaks on the cost spread out over the years in a depreciation schedule. The new law allows companies to immediately write off the full cost of buying equipment, known as expensing.“So,” the authors ask, “what does that mean?”It means that old property can still get the benefit of expensing, but only if it is sold to another party. If the original owner holds it, they have to depreciate according to the old rules; if they sell it to another party, then suddenly the full cost is eligible for expensing, and the net effect is an immediate deduction of the existing tax basis of the asset. The parties can split the resulting surplus. It appears that the buyer of the asset could even lease it back to the existing owner, so that the property doesn’t even have to go anywhere.I emailed some of the authors of this report for their individual thoughts.Mitchell Kane, a law professor at N.Y.U., wrote in response that the bill willcreate new incentives to shift tangible assets (and jobs) abroad. Given President Trump’s relentless message about U.S. jobs, it is incomprehensible to me that we are about to pass something that has this effect without any kind of meaningful discussion of the issue.He noted thatlower and middle-income families, who are especially dependent upon inflation-indexed deductions, credits, and bracket thresholds, will feel the impact increasingly as time goes on.In the first year, 2018, the changed inflation rate raises a relatively modest $31.5 billion but it grows every year, reaching $37 billion in 2027. “To be sure,” Hemel wrote, “this affects everyone to some degree, but most of the burden is paid for by families in the bottom four quintiles.”In the long term, Hemel argued,this is a very subtle way to increase taxes on the lower and middle classes and then use those revenues to pay for a massive tax cut for corporations.This full-speed-ahead strategy simultaneously constrained the ability of the press to explore the special interest provisions buried in the legislation.A tax expert who insisted on anonymity in order to protect client confidentiality, emailed me his critique of the bill:(1) The corporate rate reduction is permanent, for individuals only temporary. Completely obnoxious. In effect the money “saved” within the 10 year budget window by making those individual cuts temporary helped to underwrite the cost of making the corporate/pass though side permanent(2) Carried interest provision. When Trump was careening around in his populist candidate mode, he promised to end it. Here is one campaign promise that he “somehow” failed to redeem when the clear and available chance presented itself.(3) Restriction on state and C local tax deduction — consciously vindictive imposition of double taxation on citizens of certain Democratic states; corporations and pass through businesses, the darlings of the Republicans, still get to deduct those very same taxes in full.(4) Expanding the standard deduction but financing the cost of so doing by repealing the personal exemptions is a bit of a bait and switch maneuver. Some people might be worse off.(5) In a bill in which 100s of billions of dollars were sloshing around to provide steep tax cuts for already wealthy and highly prosperous corporations and pass through businesses, the Republicans could only find the will to raise the refundable portion of the child care tax credit from $1000 to $1400. Rubio wanted it to be raised to $2000 and his Republican brethren refused to even meet him halfway. Pitiful.(6) Deduction for extraordinary medical expenses — retention of this deduction did not even get the five-year sunset window applied to all the other individual tax provisions, two years only. Vicious.(7) Pass through business taxation — the bill is a massive tax gift to some of the wealthiest people in the country, who are conducting business operations in non-corporate form or are investors in same.What amounted to three major pieces of legislation were approved by the full House and the Senate Finance Committee, “two weeks after the bill was unveiled, without a single hearing on the 400-plus-page legislation,” as Thomas Kaplan and Alan Rappeport put it in The Times.One of our jobs is to flesh out competing views with such seriousness and respect that we should be mitigating, not exacerbating, the polarization that does exist ...Good teachers don’t shut down debate; they try to model Socratic seriousness by putting the best possible construction on arguments, even — and especially — if one doesn’t hold those positions.for a return to regular order, letting committees of jurisdiction do the principal work of crafting legislation and letting the full Senate debate and amend their efforts. We won’t settle all our differences that way, but such an approach is more likely to make progress on the central problems confronting our constituents. We might not like the compromises regular order requires, but we can and must live with them if we are to find real and lasting solutions.So far, however, only one Republican senator has suffered real costs for deciding to vote for the tax bill.No way that Bob Corker is going to vote for a tax reform bill that I think in any way is going to add to the deficit. It’s not going to happen, never. It’s never going to happen. Never, never, ever.This is the most passionate thing for me, period, that I work on. Not foreign policy. Not banking. It’s this deficit issue.For Corker, this issue went way beyond routine politics: “Deficits matter,” he forcefully asserted. “They are a greater threat to us than North Korea or ISIS.”In the end, after 11 years in the Senate, I know every bill we consider is imperfect and the question becomes is our country better off with or without this piece of legislation. I think we are better off with it.All of this raises a basic question. How could nearly every Republican representative — and all 52 Republican senators — support the tax bill? The best answer may be the most cynical: because it benefits key leaders, their friends, their heirs and their donors.After looking at the legislation in its entirety — its substance and the procedures used to get there — it is difficult to conclude that the motivations of its sponsors are either benevolent or somehow in the best interests of the country. More likely it is hypocrisy and venality mixed up into one awful bill.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONSAdvertisementAdvertisementA look from across The New York Times at the forces that shape the dress codes we share, with Vanessa Friedman as your personal shopper.

Certain names are finally coming around.”See More »Go to Home Page »AdvertisementSupported byThe story so far:In other words, Democrats smell blood, Trump’s blood.“I think when we start having to talk about the differences between sexual assault and sexual harassment and unwanted groping, you are having the wrong conversation,” Gillibrand asserted at a news conference on Dec. 6. “You need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is O.K. None of it is acceptable.”Gillibrand continued:We, as elected leaders, should absolutely be held to a higher standard, not a lower standard, and we should fundamentally be valuing women, and that is where this debate has to go.On Wednesday, Trump did Gillibrand a favor, tweeting:Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office “begging” for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump. Very disloyal to Bill & Crooked-USED!A president who would all but call Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand a whore is not fit to clean the toilets in the Barack Obama Presidential Library or to shine the shoes of George W. Bush.there were striking parallels between Trump’s Tuesday tweet and his comments in the “Access Hollywood” tape revealed during the campaign in which Trump boasts about grabbing women’s genitals.What that language suggests is that the language for Trump is sexual language. We know he uses that language in a sexual context.Abby K. Wood, a professor of law, political science and public policy at the University of Southern California, made the following case in an email:I’m struck by where the Democrats drew this line. Suppose they had drawn it somewhere between the allegations against Rep. John Conyers and those against Sen. Franken. By requesting retirement from Conyers but continuing to work with Franken, the message would have been that women should simply learn to live with some level of sexual harassment and assault. Instead, they seem to have drawn a bold line: no unwanted touching of any kind is permissible, full stop.Many women, myself included, have been grabbed the way Senator Franken is alleged to have grabbed his victims. To be told — by a political party, no less — that we should no longer expect or tolerate that kind of behavior has the potential to be wildly empowering.Jennifer Lawless, a political scientist at American University, agreed on most points with Wood. In an email, she wrote:I can think only of pluses when considering the Democrats’ strong stand against sexual harassment.Not only can Democrats claim the moral high ground, Lawless argued, but theydifferentiate themselves from the Republicans on an issue that is not wholly partisan. Doing so provides an opportunity — especially in swing states — to appeal to independents and even some moderate Republican women.Not every supporter of zero tolerance is convinced that it will help win over wavering Republican voters.Nonetheless, Klar’s research shows that:For Democratic women, feminism is very closely aligned with being a woman. 55 percent of Democratic women say that the term “feminist” describes them “very well” or “extremely well.” Only 10 percent of Republican women agree with that. Over 60 percent of Republican women say “feminist” describes them “not very well” or “not at all” — only 15 percent of Democratic women agree with that. In fact, 35 percent of Democratic men identify with the term “feminist” — more than triple the percent of Republican women who do so.Klar’s conclusion:the Democrats are not likely to win over any Republican women based on their rejection of Franken and sexual harassment. This does not appear to be as much of a priority for Republican voters.Seth Masket, a political scientist at the University of Denver, noted thatit’s no easy thing for Democrats to cast aside longstanding party leaders, but at the same time, those leaders are more expendable than Republican leaders are. Al Franken and John Conyers can easily be replaced by other Democrats, and it costs Democrats nothing to turn against Bill Clinton. Donald Trump is president.The other big plus for Democrats, according to Masket, is that the sexual harassment issue has put the Republican Party in the position ofplaying fast and loose with moral and legal rectitude, which have long been advantageous topics for them.It is now the Democrats who are drawing clear lines and saying that certain behaviors are unacceptable and must not be tolerated, while Republicans are sounding like moral relativists who will tolerate anything from people who will vote their way.Christina Wolbrecht, a political scientist at Notre Dame, made the case in an email that inaction on Franken on the part of Democrats could have had a severe negative impact:Failing to act on Franken might well have disheartened and disillusioned the activist base that the party desperately needs. This is not a question of turning Republican voters into Democratic voters, but rather of encouraging progressive voters to not just vote Democratic, but to direct their activism, donations, and energy through the party and for its candidates.In her essay, “Why the #MeToo Moment Should Be Ready for a Backlash,” Yoffe wrote:This amazing moment has a chance to be truly transformative. But it could also go off track if all accusations are taken on faith, if due process is seen as an impediment rather than a requirement and an underpinning of justice, and if men and women grow wary of each other in the workplace.“Shame on the Democrats for this stampede,” Kuttner wrote:Instead of turning on one of their own, Democrats and feminists — and all decent people — should be intensifying the pressure for a full investigation of the Groper-in-Chief.Rosenberg, in turn, declared that aDemocratic rush to judgment, casting due process to the wind, in order to strike a virtue-signaling pose that almost surely will look increasingly dark in years to come.In the heat of this intra-Democratic debate, some detect the potential for what they see as a more nuanced approach to the problem.I think this is another moment we may look back on as a moment characterized by madness and sexual panic even though it is a moment that is important in recognizing serious abuses that deserve to be called out.Bartholet argued that when the posture of Democratic senators is examinedcynically, I just wonder how much credibility it has with Democrats openly talking about the need to do this so they could be in the superior position to the Republicans.In a phone interview, Bartholet noted the dangerin going too far in limiting relational autonomy. Where do people meet other people? Largely in college, graduate school and work. You do not want to go too far in making relationships in these contexts dangerous.Since hierarchical relationships are pervasive in these environments, Bartholet argues, there is a need alsoto distinguish between sexual/romantic advances made by men in power and real abuses of power.The goal must not be simply to go as far as possible in the direction of preventing anything that some might characterize as sexual harassment. The goal must instead be to fully address sexual harassment while at the same time protecting students against unfair and inappropriate discipline, honoring individual relationship autonomy, and maintaining the values of academic freedom. The law that the Supreme Court and lower federal courts have developed under Title IX and Title VII attempts to balance all these important interests. The university’s sexual harassment policy departs dramatically from these legal principles, jettisoning balance and fairness in the rush to appease certain federal administrative officials.With both political parties coming to realize that the issue of sexual harassment and misconduct may determine who is inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2021, the goal of “balanced” interests will be superseded, at least temporarily, by exigent political considerations.Insofar as sexual harassment and misconduct become an electoral issue, it will help the Democrats, but the party cannot depend on that alone to produce a change in control of either branch of Congress. No one knows what the half life of this issue is. Although right now it seems unlikely, it could once again become nearly as invisible as it was three months ago. At the moment, the Democrats’ best ally in building the momentum necessary for a power shift is Trump himself, who has been doing all he can to create the next Democratic wave.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
